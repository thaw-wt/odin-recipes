    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 head garlic</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 pound frozen large deveined, shell-on shrimp, thawed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons rice flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Separate garlic cloves into a bowl; place another bowl on top. Shake until all peels separate from cloves, about 30 seconds, being careful not to shake too hard. Mince garlic cloves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in a sauté pan over medium heat; add minced garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes; transfer to a small bowl and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pat thawed shrimp dry with paper towels; add to a large mixing bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine rice flour, paprika, salt, and cayenne pepper in a small bowl; sprinkle over shrimp and toss until completely coated using a large spoon or spatula.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp in a single layer, in batches, and cook until browned and just barely cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Add some garlic butter; cook for 30 seconds more. Repeat with remaining shrimp and garlic butter. Serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
      This recipe can be made with shell-off shrimp for easier eating, but using shrimp with the shells on is the classic method. I think the best size shrimp to use are 21 to 25 per pound.

      All-purpose flour can be substituted for rice flour if preferred.
